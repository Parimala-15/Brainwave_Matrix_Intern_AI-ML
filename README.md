# 💼 Internship Projects at Brainwave Matrix Solutions

This repository showcases the **internship work completed by Parimala Dharshini** at **Brainwave Matrix Solutions** as part of the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning domain. During the internship, I worked on two core AI projects focused on:

1. 🎨 Text-to-Image Generation using OpenAI's GLIDE
2. 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning


## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1️⃣ Text-to-Image Generation using GLIDE

**Objective**: Generate realistic images based on text prompts like `"pug dog"` using OpenAI’s GLIDE model.

**Highlights**:
- Used diffusion-based image synthesis (GLIDE)
- Generated 64x64 base images from prompts
- Enhanced output quality using:
  - Bilinear interpolation
  - Sharpening filters
  - Bilateral filters via OpenCV
- Visualized and compared different enhancement outputs

### 2️⃣ Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

**Objective**: Build a classifier that detects whether a news article is real or fake.

**Highlights**:
- Preprocessed text data: tokenization, stopword removal, vectorization
- Applied TF-IDF for feature extraction
- Trained a Logistic Regression classifier
- Achieved high accuracy and saved the model using `joblib` for reuse
- Suitable for integration with a web app or API

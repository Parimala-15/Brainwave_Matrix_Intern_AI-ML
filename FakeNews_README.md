# üì∞ Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to identify whether a given news article is **real or fake** using a supervised machine learning approach. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms, it can classify news headlines or article texts with high accuracy.

## üìå Project Overview
Dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tAKatHyuMIRH19hdvmrnsr5yiiuHCXc6?usp=drive_link
Misinformation and fake news have become increasingly prevalent, especially on social media platforms. This Fake News Detection system takes a textual news input and classifies it as **Fake** or **Real**.

üîç The project uses:
- **TF-IDF vectorization** for feature extraction
- **Logistic Regression** classifier
- **Model serialization** using `joblib`
- Trained on a labeled dataset of real and fake news

## ‚ú® Key Features

- ‚úÖ Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
- ‚úÖ TF-IDF vectorization of text data
- ‚úÖ Logistic Regression model for classification
- ‚úÖ Accuracy evaluation on train/test split
- ‚úÖ Saved model (`model.pkl`) for deployment or API use

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Stopword removal
- Lowercasing
- Removing punctuation and special characters
- Tokenization

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Extraction
- Uses **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to convert text into numerical features.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
- A **Logistic Regression** classifier is trained to distinguish fake from real news.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Prediction & Evaluation
- The model is evaluated using **accuracy**, **precision**, and **recall** on both train and test sets.
